          Try to answer the five coding questions within the time limit. You have 100 seconds, 10 seconds per question. If you answer a question incorrectly, time will be deducted. When all the questions are answered, or the timer runs out, the game is over. At the end of the game, you can save your score! The faster you can answer the questions (correctly!), the higher your score! Good luck!
